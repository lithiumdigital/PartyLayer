/**
 * @partylayer/react v2: useAllocationAction (TanStack Query mutation).
 *
 * The action sibling of `useTransferInstructionAction`, over a funded CIP-0056
 * `Allocation` contract. It exercises one of the standard choices that act on an
 * allocation. Scope: funded-allocation actions only.
 *
 * The three standard choices on an `Allocation` contract and their semantics
 * (each takes ONLY `extraArgs`):
 *   - `Allocation_ExecuteTransfer` executes the actual transfer of the allocated
 *     assets. Controller: the allocation controllers (sender, receiver, and
 *     executor); typically the sender and receiver delegate to the executor via
 *     the settlement contract, so the settlement app triggers it. SHOULD succeed
 *     before `settlement.settleBefore`. FUND SAFETY: this moves the actual assets
 *     of the settlement leg.
 *   - `Allocation_Cancel` releases the allocated assets early when the settlement
 *     is aborted or has definitely failed. Controller: the allocation controllers.
 *   - `Allocation_Withdraw` withdraws the allocated assets before settlement
 *     completes. Controller: the SENDER. SHOULD not fail the settlement if the
 *     sender still has time to re-allocate (before `settlement.allocateBefore`).
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED:
 *   - `AllocationInstruction_Update`: the registry's internal workflow choice
 *     (controller: the instrument admin plus extra actors), not a wallet-user
 *     action.
 *   - `AllocationInstruction_Withdraw`: withdrawing a PENDING `AllocationInstruction`
 *     is a real sender action, but it targets the `AllocationInstruction` interface,
 *     a DIFFERENT contract than the funded `Allocation` this hook acts on. Mixing
 *     the two contract-id semantics in one hook would be confusing. A dApp can use
 *     the generic `useChoice` for it today; a typed variant may follow later.
 *
 * MODEL 2: an allocation action is a ledger write, which under Model 2 the dApp
 * owns. Like `useTransferInstructionAction`, this hook does **not** touch the
 * PartyLayer client, does not call `usePartyLayer`, and does not reach any ledger
 * itself. Each choice's `extraArgs.context` comes from the registry's off-ledger
 * Token Standard API, alongside the `disclosedContracts`, so PartyLayer cannot and
 * must not model them. The dApp supplies its OWN submit fetcher; the hook only
 * types the request and wraps it in `useMutation` and keys it.
 *
 * Example of a dApp `submit` (stays in the dApp, NOT in the hook):
 *
 *   const submit = async (request, signal) => {
 *     const choice =
 *       request.action === 'executeTransfer' ? 'Allocation_ExecuteTransfer'
 *         : request.action === 'cancel' ? 'Allocation_Cancel'
 *         : 'Allocation_Withdraw';
 *     const ctx = await registry.getAllocationChoiceContext(
 *       { allocationCid: request.allocationCid, action: request.action },
 *       signal,
 *     );
 *     return submitExercise({
 *       contractId: request.allocationCid,
 *       choice,
 *       choiceArgument: { extraArgs: { context: ctx.choiceContext, meta: request.meta ?? {} } },
 *       disclosedContracts: ctx.disclosedContracts,
 *     }, signal);
 *   };
 *
 * The result stays generic `R` (the dApp's submit pipeline shape), exactly like
 * `useTransferInstructionAction`.
 *
 * Returns the TanStack mutation result spread, plus wagmi-style aliases:
 *   - `submitAction`      === `mutate`      (fire-and-forget)
 *   - `submitActionAsync` === `mutateAsync` (returns Promise<R>; throws on error)
 *
 * The QueryClient is supplied by the CONSUMER's `QueryClientProvider`.
