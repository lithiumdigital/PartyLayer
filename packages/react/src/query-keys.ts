/**
 * Query-key factory for @partylayer/react v2 (TanStack Query v5).
 *
 * Wagmi-style hierarchical keys: a single root scope (`all`) plus a factory per
 * operation, so consumers and our hooks can invalidate precisely (e.g.
 * `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: partyLayerKeys.all })` clears
 * everything; `partyLayerKeys.wallets()` clears just the wallet list).
 *
 * Keys are `as const` tuples so TanStack's structural matching is exact and the
 * key shape is part of the public, stable contract.
