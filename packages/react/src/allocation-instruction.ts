/**
 * @partylayer/react v2: useAllocationInstruction (TanStack Query mutation).
 *
 * A CIP-0056 (Canton Token Standard) typed specialization of `useChoice` for the
 * AllocationInstructionV1 `AllocationFactory_Allocate` flow. It is the allocation
 * sibling of `useTransferInstruction`: where that hook creates a transfer via the
 * transfer factory, this one CREATES an allocation via the allocation factory.
 * The controller is the transfer leg's sender; the choice returns an
 * `AllocationInstructionResult`.
 *
 * An allocation earmarks (locks) a sender's holdings to fund one leg of a
 * settlement, so the settlement's executor can later move the assets. Depending on
 * the registry, exercising the factory creates the `Allocation` directly or an
 * `AllocationInstruction` first.
 *
 * MODEL 2: creating an allocation is a ledger write, which under Model 2 the dApp
 * owns. Like `useTransferInstruction`, this hook does **not** touch the PartyLayer
 * client, does not call `usePartyLayer`, and does not reach any ledger itself. The
 * registry factory fetch, the `choiceContext`, the `disclosedContracts`, and the
 * command submission are registry-specific and off-ledger, so PartyLayer cannot
 * and must not model them. The dApp supplies its OWN submit fetcher; the hook only
 * types the request and wraps it in `useMutation` and keys it.
 *
 * The registry flow mirrors the transfer factory: POST the registry's
 * allocation-instruction endpoint
 * (`/registry/allocation-instruction/v1/allocation-factory`) to get the
 * `factoryId`, `choiceContext`, and `disclosedContracts`; fill
 * `extraArgs.context`; exercise `AllocationFactory_Allocate` on the factory with
 * the `disclosedContracts`.
 *
 * Example of a dApp `submit` (stays in the dApp, NOT in the hook):
 *
 *   const submit = async (request, signal) => {
 *     const factory = await registry.getAllocationFactory(
 *       { allocation: request.allocation, expectedAdmin: request.expectedAdmin },
 *       signal,
 *     );
 *     return submitExercise({
 *       factoryId: factory.factoryId,
 *       choice: 'AllocationFactory_Allocate',
 *       choiceArgs: {
 *         expectedAdmin: request.expectedAdmin,
 *         allocation: request.allocation,
 *         requestedAt: request.requestedAt,
 *         inputHoldingCids: request.inputHoldingCids,
 *         extraArgs: { context: factory.choiceContext, meta: request.meta ?? {} },
 *       },
 *       disclosedContracts: factory.disclosedContracts,
 *     }, signal);
 *   };
 *
 * The Daml result is `AllocationInstructionResult` (its `output`, plus
 * `senderChangeCids` and `meta`), but the dApp's submit pipeline shape is its own,
 * so `R` stays generic (default `unknown`), exactly like `useTransferInstruction`.
 *
 * Returns the TanStack mutation result spread, plus wagmi-style aliases:
 *   - `submitAllocation`      === `mutate`      (fire-and-forget)
 *   - `submitAllocationAsync` === `mutateAsync` (returns Promise<R>; throws on error)
 *
 * The QueryClient is supplied by the CONSUMER's `QueryClientProvider`.
