# @cantonconnect/registry-client

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Repair the `@partylayer/core` dependency reference.

  `0.3.0` was published declaring `@partylayer/core@^0.2.7`, but its compiled
  bundle imports nine symbols from core (the CIP-0103 detection helpers and
  related types) that only exist in `@partylayer/core@0.3.0+`. This release
  pins the dependency to the correct core range.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7770870: Registry-driven detection and adapter-aware picker readiness.

  `@partylayer/core` and `@partylayer/registry-client` introduce a multi-signal `providerDetection` schema on `RegistryWalletEntry`. Registry entries can declare a transport plus an ordered list of matcher rules (`domain`, `exact`, `prefix`) over the live CIP-0103 `status` shape — `kernel.url`, `kernel.userUrl`, `kernel.id`. This lets new CIP-0103 wallets be added to the ecosystem through a registry JSON update without an SDK code change, and lets the SDK identify a wallet by stable signals (vendor domain) when the per-install identity field (`kernel.id`) varies. The matcher engine is OR-combined, case-insensitive on domains, case-sensitive on exact values, and short-circuits on first match. 33 unit tests cover the matcher semantics.

  The registry-client schema also gains an optional `RegistryWalletEntry.beta?: boolean` flag and a `RegistryWalletEntry.cip0103?: { native, evidence, since }` marker. The picker UI uses `cip0103.native` to surface CIP-0103-native wallets in a dedicated section regardless of install state. The optional `beta` flag, when present on any entry, propagates through `WalletInfo.metadata.beta = 'true'` so UIs can render a "Beta" badge generically.

  `@partylayer/sdk` re-exports the detection helpers (`isCip0103Native`, `Cip0103Support`, `ProviderDetection`, `matchesProviderDetection`) and adds `getAdapter(walletId)` for adapter-aware UI integrations that need to probe `detectInstalled()` directly. The `tsup` external list grew to externalise all built-in adapter packages — the bundled SDK dist drops from ~80 KB ESM to ~30 KB ESM with no public API change.

  `@partylayer/react` renders the optional Beta badge in the wallet picker modal from `WalletInfo.metadata.beta`. The picker also adds an adapter-aware NATIVE readiness probe: when an adapter implements `detectInstalled()`, the picker reflects its result rather than guessing from a static install hint.
