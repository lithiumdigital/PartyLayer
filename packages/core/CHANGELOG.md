# @partylayer/core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9642aee: feat(core): add CAIP-2 network utilities (CANTON_NETWORKS, toCAIP2Network, fromCAIP2Network, isValidCAIP2)

  These moved from @partylayer/core's consumer (@partylayer/provider) into core so
  the lower adapter layer can derive a WalletConnect CAIP-2 chain from a
  PartyLayer NetworkId without an illegal upward import. Additive — provider
  re-exports them unchanged.

- 2c4c10c: feat(core): NetworkMismatchError + detectNetworkMismatch + Session.networkMismatch
  - `NetworkMismatchError` (code `NETWORK_MISMATCH`, public `expected`/`actual`).
  - `detectNetworkMismatch(expected, actual)` — conservative: returns the
    normalized `{expected, actual}` only for a confident, recognized,
    DIFFERENT-network mismatch; `null` otherwise (never a false positive).
  - Optional `Session.networkMismatch?: { expected; actual }` (additive).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 53b1714: WalletConnect / QR-only wallets now show a scannable QR **in the connect modal**
  out of the box (no integrator wiring), with a mobile deep-link, and the official
  dapp-sdk blank `about:blank` popup is suppressed.
  - **core / sdk:** add an optional `onDisplayUri(uri)` callback to the adapter
    `connect()` options and to `ConnectOptions`. Adapters call it with a
    pairing/display URI (e.g. a WalletConnect `wc:` URI) the moment one is
    produced, before approval; the connect UI uses it to render a QR / deep-link.
    Backward-compatible (optional).
  - **adapter-walletconnect:** the official adapter's `onUri` is now always
    wrapped so the pairing URI is fanned out to BOTH the integrator's
    `config.onUri` AND the per-connect `onDisplayUri` — no hand-wiring needed. The
    adapter also narrowly intercepts the official adapter's blank
    `window.open('', 'wallet-popup')` during connect (no config flag exists to
    disable it) and restores `window.open` afterward.
  - **react:** the modal renders the WC QR itself. `handleWalletClick` passes
    `onDisplayUri` for non-dual (QR-only / remote-signer) wallets and enters the
    QR view only once a URI actually arrives (wallets that draw their own QR are
    unaffected). QR generated via `qrcode` (new dependency). Copy is
    wallet-agnostic for the generic WalletConnect entry ("Scan with your Canton
    wallet" / "Open wallet"). The dual-transport (Console) extension + placeholder
    QR-fallback flow is unchanged.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Generalize `readField` in detection logic to read any top-level object on the status response, not just `kernel.*`. This is backward-compatible — existing `kernel.*` matchers continue to behave identically; this only enables matchers to also target `provider.*` and other future field paths in wallet status responses. Backward compatibility is enforced by a new parity test suite covering every status shape existing adapters can encounter.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Promote CIP-0103 wallet-detection utilities to the public API surface.

  The following symbols were already imported by `@partylayer/registry-client`
  and `@partylayer/adapter-send` internally, but were not declared as exports
  in any published version of `@partylayer/core`:
  - `matchesProviderDetection`, `isCip0103Native`
  - `findMatchingWallet`, `findMatchingWalletInfo`, `deriveGenericWalletName`
  - type-only: `ProviderDetection`, `ProviderMatcher`, `Cip0103Support`,
    `Cip0103StatusForDetection`

  This release makes them part of the stable public API. No exports removed;
  fully backward-compatible with 0.2.x.

## 0.2.6
