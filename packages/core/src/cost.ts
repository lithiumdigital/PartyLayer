/**
 * Traffic-cost types for the cost-visibility UX layer.
 *
 * These are a lightweight, standard representation of the cost fields the Canton
 * JSON Ledger API already exposes (Canton 3.5.5). PartyLayer does NOT own ledger
 * transport. The dApp supplies its own cost-fetcher against its validator; this
 * module only provides the shared types + pure helpers so `@partylayer/react` and
 * (later) `@partylayer/vue` can build cost hooks/UI on a common foundation.
 *
 * Field names below mirror the node's OpenAPI schema verbatim:
 *   - estimate (pre-execution):   `CostEstimation` (under
 *     `JsPrepareSubmissionResponse.costEstimation`, optional on the response)
 *   - actual (post-execution):    `paidTrafficCost` (on the completion,
 *     authoritative for command-driven flows, and on the transaction)
 *
 * All cost values are int64 on the wire and can exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`,
 * so they are represented as a 64-bit-safe decimal string ({@link TrafficCost})
 * rather than a JS `number`. Use {@link trafficCostToBigInt} for arithmetic.
 */

/**
 * A non-negative int64 traffic-cost amount, stored as a canonical decimal string
 * to survive values beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` without precision loss.
 *
 * Branded (following the convention in `types.ts`, e.g. `TransactionHash`) so a
 * raw `string` cannot be passed where a validated cost is expected. Construct via
 * {@link toTrafficCost}; convert for arithmetic via {@link trafficCostToBigInt}.
