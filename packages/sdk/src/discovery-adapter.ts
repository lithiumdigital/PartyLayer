/**
 * Generic bridge from an official `@canton-network/core-wallet-discovery`
 * `ProviderAdapter` (matched structurally as `OfficialProviderAdapter`) to our
 * `WalletAdapter` contract.
 *
 * This is the GENERIC host for popup/remote Canton wallets that neither inject
 * `window.canton` nor announce via `canton:announceProvider` (e.g. Walley): the
 * app supplies the wallet's OWN official adapter instance in `config.adapters`,
 * and the SDK auto-wraps it here. There is NO wallet-specific package in our
 * codebase — any standards-compliant wallet shipping the official ProviderAdapter
 * shape inherits this path. We deliberately do NOT import `@canton-network/*`
 * (mirroring `@partylayer/provider`'s extension-channel); the standard's SHAPE
 * is the contract.
 *
 * Sibling to `GenericAnnounceAdapter`: both delegate every call to a
 * `CIP0103Provider`. The difference is the source — here the provider comes from
 * the official adapter's `provider()` (obtained LAZILY so SDK init stays
 * SSR-safe; the wallet's `provider()` may touch `window`).
 *
 * Host/network are baked into the app-supplied official adapter at construction
 * (e.g. `new WalleyAdapter({ host: 'https://dev.walley.cc' })`), so the bridge
 * never sees or sets them.
 *
 * Eventless note: the official provider exposes `on`/`emit`/`removeListener`
 * but popup/remote wallets typically never emit. The session layer restores via
 * `status`/`listAccounts` polling + persists on fresh connect, so this is
 * tolerated; `getCapabilities()` therefore NEVER returns `'events'`.
